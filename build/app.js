	/**
	 * Bootstrapping for Angular applications.
	 *
	 * You instantiate an Angular application by explicitly specifying a component to use
	 * as the root component for your application via the `bootstrap()` method.
	 *
	 * ## Simple Example
	 *
	 * Assuming this `index.html`:
	 *
	 * ```html
	 * <html>
	 *   <!-- load Angular script tags here. -->
	 *   <body>
	 *     <my-app>loading...</my-app>
	 *   </body>
	 * </html>
	 * ```
	 *
	 * An application is bootstrapped inside an existing browser DOM, typically `index.html`.
	 * Unlike Angular 1, Angular 2 does not compile/process providers in `index.html`. This is
	 * mainly for security reasons, as well as architectural changes in Angular 2. This means
	 * that `index.html` can safely be processed using server-side technologies such as
	 * providers. Bindings can thus use double-curly `{{ syntax }}` without collision from
	 * Angular 2 component double-curly `{{ syntax }}`.
	 *
	 * We can use this script code:
	 *
	 * {@example core/ts/bootstrap/bootstrap.ts region='bootstrap'}
	 *
	 * When the app developer invokes `bootstrap()` with the root component `MyApp` as its
	 * argument, Angular performs the following tasks:
	 *
	 *  1. It uses the component's `selector` property to locate the DOM element which needs
	 *     to be upgraded into the angular component.
	 *  2. It creates a new child injector (from the platform injector). Optionally, you can
	 *     also override the injector configuration for an app by invoking `bootstrap` with the
	 *     `componentInjectableBindings` argument.
	 *  3. It creates a new `Zone` and connects it to the angular application's change detection
	 *     domain instance.
	 *  4. It creates an emulated or shadow DOM on the selected component's host element and loads the
	 *     template into it.
	 *  5. It instantiates the specified component.
	 *  6. Finally, Angular performs change detection to apply the initial data providers for the
	 *     application.
	 *
	 *
	 * ## Bootstrapping Multiple Applications
	 *
	 * When working within a browser window, there are many singleton resources: cookies, title,
	 * location, and others. Angular services that represent these resources must likewise be
	 * shared across all Angular applications that occupy the same browser window. For this
	 * reason, Angular creates exactly one global platform object which stores all shared
	 * services, and each angular application injector has the platform injector as its parent.
	 *
	 * Each application has its own private injector as well. When there are multiple
	 * applications on a page, Angular treats each application injector's services as private
	 * to that application.
	 *
	 * ## API
	 *
	 * - `appComponentType`: The root component which should act as the application. This is
	 *   a reference to a `Type` which is annotated with `@Component(...)`.
	 * - `customProviders`: An additional set of providers that can be added to the
	 *   app injector to override default injection behavior.
	 *
	 * Returns a `Promise` of {@link ComponentRef}.

	/**
	 * A regular expression for breaking a URI into its component parts.
	 *
	 * {@link http://www.gbiv.com/protocols/uri/rfc/rfc3986.html#RFC2234} says
	 * As the "first-match-wins" algorithm is identical to the "greedy"
	 * disambiguation method used by POSIX regular expressions, it is natural and
	 * commonplace to use a regular expression for parsing the potential five
	 * components of a URI reference.
	 *
	 * The following line is the regular expression for breaking-down a
	 * well-formed URI reference into its components.
	 *
	 * <pre>
	 * ^(([^:/?#]+):)?(//([^/?#]*))?([^?#]*)(\?([^#]*))?(#(.*))?
	 *  12            3  4          5       6  7        8 9
	 * </pre>
	 *
	 * The numbers in the second line above are only to assist readability; they
	 * indicate the reference points for each subexpression (i.e., each paired
	 * parenthesis). We refer to the value matched for subexpression <n> as $<n>.
	 * For example, matching the above expression to
	 * <pre>
	 *     http://www.ics.uci.edu/pub/ietf/uri/#Related
	 * </pre>
	 * results in the following subexpression matches:
	 * <pre>
	 *    $1 = http:
	 *    $2 = http
	 *    $3 = //www.ics.uci.edu
	 *    $4 = www.ics.uci.edu
	 *    $5 = /pub/ietf/uri/
	 *    $6 = <undefined>
	 *    $7 = <undefined>
	 *    $8 = #Related
	 *    $9 = Related
	 * </pre>
	 * where <undefined> indicates that the component is not present, as is the
	 * case for the query component in the above example. Therefore, we can
	 * determine the value of the five components as
	 * <pre>
	 *    scheme    = $2
	 *    authority = $4
	 *    path      = $5
	 *    query     = $7
	 *    fragment  = $9
	 * </pre>
	 *
	 * The regular expression has been modified slightly to expose the
	 * userInfo, domain, and port separately from the authority.
	 * The modified version yields
	 * <pre>
	 *    $1 = http              scheme
	 *    $2 = <undefined>       userInfo -\
	 *    $3 = www.ics.uci.edu   domain     | authority
	 *    $4 = <undefined>       port     -/
	 *    $5 = /pub/ietf/uri/    path
	 *    $6 = <undefined>       query without ?
	 *    $7 = Related           fragment without #

	  This is a limited shim for ShadowDOM css styling.
	  https://dvcs.w3.org/hg/webcomponents/raw-file/tip/spec/shadow/index.html#styles
	
	  The intention here is to support only the styling features which can be
	  relatively simply implemented. The goal is to allow users to avoid the
	  most obvious pitfalls and do so without compromising performance significantly.
	  For ShadowDOM styling that's not covered here, a set of best practices
	  can be provided that should allow users to accomplish more complex styling.
	
	  The following is a list of specific ShadowDOM styling features and a brief
	  discussion of the approach used to shim.
	
	  Shimmed features:
	
	  * :host, :host-context: ShadowDOM allows styling of the shadowRoot's host
	  element using the :host rule. To shim this feature, the :host styles are
	  reformatted and prefixed with a given scope name and promoted to a
	  document level stylesheet.
	  For example, given a scope name of .foo, a rule like this:
	
	    :host {
	        background: red;
	      }
	    }
	
	  becomes:
	
	    .foo {
	      background: red;
	    }
	
	  * encapsultion: Styles defined within ShadowDOM, apply only to
	  dom inside the ShadowDOM. Polymer uses one of two techniques to implement
	  this feature.
	
	  By default, rules are prefixed with the host element tag name
	  as a descendant selector. This ensures styling does not leak out of the 'top'
	  of the element's ShadowDOM. For example,
	
	  div {
	      font-weight: bold;
	    }
	
	  becomes:
	
	  x-foo div {
	      font-weight: bold;
	    }
	
	  becomes:
	
	
	  Alternatively, if WebComponents.ShadowCSS.strictStyling is set to true then
	  selectors are scoped by adding an attribute selector suffix to each
	  simple selector that contains the host element tag name. Each element
	  in the element's ShadowDOM template is also given the scope attribute.
	  Thus, these rules match only elements that have the scope attribute.
	  For example, given a scope name of x-foo, a rule like this:
	
	    div {
	      font-weight: bold;
	    }
	
	  becomes:
	
	    div[x-foo] {
	      font-weight: bold;
	    }
	
	  Note that elements that are dynamically added to a scope must have the scope
	  selector added to them manually.
	
	  * upper/lower bound encapsulation: Styles which are defined outside a
	  shadowRoot should not cross the ShadowDOM boundary and should not apply
	  inside a shadowRoot.
	
	  This styling behavior is not emulated. Some possible ways to do this that
	  were rejected due to complexity and/or performance concerns include: (1) reset
	  every possible property for every possible selector for a given scope name;
	  (2) re-implement css in javascript.
	
	  As an alternative, users should make sure to use selectors
	  specific to the scope in which they are working.
	
	  * ::distributed: This behavior is not emulated. It's often not necessary
	  to style the contents of a specific insertion point and instead, descendants
	  of the host element can be styled selectively. Users can also create an
	  extra node around an insertion point and style that node's contents
	  via descendent selectors. For example, with a shadowRoot like this:
	
	    <style>
	      ::content(div) {
	        background: red;
	      }
	    </style>
	    <content></content>
	
	  could become:
	
	    <style>
	      / *@polyfill .content-container div * /
	      ::content(div) {
	        background: red;
	      }
	    </style>
	    <div class="content-container">
	      <content></content>
	    </div>
	
	  Note the use of @polyfill in the comment above a ShadowDOM specific style
	  declaration. This is a directive to the styling shim to use the selector
	  in comments in lieu of the next selector when running under polyfill.

	/**
	 * This array represents the DOM schema. It encodes inheritance, properties, and events.
	 *
	 * ## Overview
	 *
	 * Each line represents one kind of element. The `element_inheritance` and properties are joined
	 * using `element_inheritance|preperties` syntax.
	 *
	 * ## Element Inheritance
	 *
	 * The `element_inheritance` can be further subdivided as `element1,element2,...^parentElement`.
	 * Here the individual elements are separated by `,` (commas). Every element in the list
	 * has identical properties.
	 *
	 * An `element` may inherit additional properties from `parentElement` If no `^parentElement` is
	 * specified then `""` (blank) element is assumed.
	 *
	 * NOTE: The blank element inherits from root `*` element, the super element of all elements.
	 *
	 * NOTE an element prefix such as `@svg:` has no special meaning to the schema.
	 *
	 * ## Properties
	 *
	 * Each element has a set of properties separated by `,` (commas). Each property can be prefixed
	 * by a special character designating its type:
	 *
	 * - (no prefix): property is a string.
	 * - `*`: property represents an event.
	 * - `!`: property is a boolean.
	 * - `#`: property is a number.
	 * - `%`: property is an object.
	 *
	 * ## Query
	 *
	 * The class creates an internal squas representaino which allows to easily answer the query of
	 * if a given property exist on a given element.
	 *
	 * NOTE: We don't yet support querying for types or events.
	 * NOTE: This schema is auto extracted from `schema_extractor.ts` located in the test folder.

	 * @param {Object} tasks - An object. Each of its properties is either a

	 * in the array. The object's key of a property serves as the name of the task
	 * defined by that property, i.e. can be used when specifying requirements for
	 * other tasks. The function receives one or two arguments:
	 * * a `results` object, containing the results of the previously executed
	 *   functions, only passed if the task has any dependencies,
	 * * a `callback(err, result)` function, which must be called when finished,
	 *   passing an `error` (which can be `null`) and the result of the function's
	 *   execution.
	 * @param {number} [concurrency=Infinity] - An optional `integer` for
	 * determining the maximum number of tasks that can be run in parallel. By
	 * default, as many as possible.
	 * @param {Function} [callback] - An optional callback which is called when all
	 * the tasks have been completed. It receives the `err` argument if any `tasks`
	 * pass an error to their callback. Results are always returned; however, if an
	 * error occurs, no further `tasks` will be performed, and the results object
	 * will only contain partial results. Invoked with (err, results).

	/**
	 * A dependency-injected version of the [async.auto]{@link module:ControlFlow.auto} function. Dependent
	 * tasks are specified as parameters to the function, after the usual callback
	 * parameter, with the parameter names matching the names of the tasks it
	 * depends on. This can provide even more readable task graphs which can be
	 * easier to maintain.
	 *
	 * If a final callback is specified, the task results are similarly injected,
	 * specified as named parameters after the initial error parameter.
	 *
	 * The autoInject function is purely syntactic sugar and its semantics are
	 * otherwise equivalent to [async.auto]{@link module:ControlFlow.auto}.
	 *
	 * @name autoInject
	 * @static
	 * @memberOf module:ControlFlow
	 * @method
	 * @see [async.auto]{@link module:ControlFlow.auto}
	 * @category Control Flow
	 * @param {Object} tasks - An object, each of whose properties is an {@link AsyncFunction} of
	 * the form 'func([dependencies...], callback). The object's key of a property
	 * serves as the name of the task defined by that property, i.e. can be used
	 * when specifying requirements for other tasks.
	 * * The `callback` parameter is a `callback(err, result)` which must be called
	 *   when finished, passing an `error` (which can be `null`) and the result of
	 *   the function's execution. The remaining parameters name other tasks on
	 *   which the task is dependent, and the results from those tasks are the
	 *   arguments of those parameters.
	 * @param {Function} [callback] - An optional callback which is called when all
	 * the tasks have been completed. It receives the `err` argument if any `tasks`
	 * pass an error to their callback, and a `results` object with any completed
	 * task results, similar to `auto`.
	 * @example
	 *
	 * //  The example from `auto` can be rewritten as follows:
	 * async.autoInject({
	 *     get_data: function(callback) {
	 *         // async code to get some data
	 *         callback(null, 'data', 'converted to array');
	 *     },
	 *     make_folder: function(callback) {
	 *         // async code to create a directory to store a file in
	 *         // this is run at the same time as getting the data
	 *         callback(null, 'folder');
	 *     },
	 *     write_file: function(get_data, make_folder, callback) {
	 *         // once there is some data and the directory exists,
	 *         // write the data to a file in the directory
	 *         callback(null, 'filename');
	 *     },
	 *     email_link: function(write_file, callback) {
	 *         // once the file is written let's email a link to it...
	 *         // write_file contains the filename returned by write_file.
	 *         callback(null, {'file':write_file, 'email':'user@example.com'});
	 *     }
	 * }, function(err, results) {
	 *     console.log('err = ', err);
	 *     console.log('email_link = ', results.email_link);
	 * });
	 *
	 * // If you are using a JS minifier that mangles parameter names, `autoInject`
	 * // will not work with plain functions, since the parameter names will be
	 * // collapsed to a single letter identifier.  To work around this, you can
	 * // explicitly specify the names of the parameters your task function needs
	 * // in an array, similar to Angular.js dependency injection.
	 *
	 * // This still has an advantage over plain `auto`, since the results a task
	 * // depends on are still spread into arguments.
	 * async.autoInject({
	 *     //...
	 *     write_file: ['get_data', 'make_folder', function(get_data, make_folder, callback) {
	 *         callback(null, 'filename');
	 *     }],
	 *     email_link: ['write_file', function(write_file, callback) {
	 *         callback(null, {'file':write_file, 'email':'user@example.com'});
	 *     }]
	 *     //...
	 * }, function(err, results) {

	/**
	 * An "async function" in the context of Async is an asynchronous function with
	 * a variable number of parameters, with the final parameter being a callback.
	 * (`function (arg1, arg2, ..., callback) {}`)
	 * The final callback is of the form `callback(err, results...)`, which must be
	 * called once the function is completed.  The callback should be called with a
	 * Error as its first argument to signal that an error occurred.
	 * Otherwise, if no error occurred, it should be called with `null` as the first
	 * argument, and any additional `result` arguments that may apply, to signal
	 * successful completion.
	 * The callback must be called exactly once, ideally on a later tick of the
	 * JavaScript event loop.
	 *
	 * This type of function is also referred to as a "Node-style async function",
	 * or a "continuation passing-style function" (CPS). Most of the methods of this
	 * library are themselves CPS/Node-style async functions, or functions that
	 * return CPS/Node-style async functions.
	 *
	 * Wherever we accept a Node-style async function, we also directly accept an
	 * [ES2017 `async` function]{@link https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/async_function}.
	 * In this case, the `async` function will not be passed a final callback
	 * argument, and any thrown error will be used as the `err` argument of the
	 * implicit callback, and the return value will be used as the `result` value.
	 * (i.e. a `rejected` of the returned Promise becomes the `err` callback
	 * argument, and a `resolved` value becomes the `result`.)
	 *
	 * Note, due to JavaScript limitations, we can only detect native `async`
	 * functions and not transpilied implementations.
	 * Your environment must have `async`/`await` support for this to work.
	 * (e.g. Node > v7.6, or a recent version of a modern browser).
	 * If you are using `async` functions through a transpiler (e.g. Babel), you
	 * must still wrap the function with [asyncify]{@link module:Utils.asyncify},
	 * because the `async function` will be compiled to an ordinary function that
	 * returns a promise.

	     * Creates a `lodash` object which wraps `value` to enable implicit method
	     * chain sequences. Methods that operate on and return arrays, collections,
	     * and functions can be chained together. Methods that retrieve a single value
	     * or may return a primitive value will automatically end the chain sequence
	     * and return the unwrapped value. Otherwise, the value must be unwrapped
	     * with `_#value`.
	     *
	     * Explicit chain sequences, which must be unwrapped with `_#value`, may be
	     * enabled using `_.chain`.
	     *
	     * The execution of chained methods is lazy, that is, it's deferred until
	     * `_#value` is implicitly or explicitly called.
	     *
	     * Lazy evaluation allows several methods to support shortcut fusion.
	     * Shortcut fusion is an optimization to merge iteratee calls; this avoids
	     * the creation of intermediate arrays and can greatly reduce the number of
	     * iteratee executions. Sections of a chain sequence qualify for shortcut
	     * fusion if the section is applied to an array and iteratees accept only
	     * one argument. The heuristic for whether a section qualifies for shortcut
	     * fusion is subject to change.
	     *
	     * Chaining is supported in custom builds as long as the `_#value` method is
	     * directly or indirectly included in the build.
	     *
	     * In addition to lodash methods, wrappers have `Array` and `String` methods.
	     *
	     * The wrapper `Array` methods are:
	     * `concat`, `join`, `pop`, `push`, `shift`, `sort`, `splice`, and `unshift`
	     *
	     * The wrapper `String` methods are:
	     * `replace` and `split`
	     *
	     * The wrapper methods that support shortcut fusion are:
	     * `at`, `compact`, `drop`, `dropRight`, `dropWhile`, `filter`, `find`,
	     * `findLast`, `head`, `initial`, `last`, `map`, `reject`, `reverse`, `slice`,
	     * `tail`, `take`, `takeRight`, `takeRightWhile`, `takeWhile`, and `toArray`
	     *
	     * The chainable wrapper methods are:

	// a transform stream is a readable/writable stream where you do
	// something with the data.  Sometimes it's called a "filter",
	// but that's not a great name for it, since that implies a thing where
	// some bits pass through, and others are simply ignored.  (That would
	// be a valid example of a transform, of course.)
	//
	// While the output is causally related to the input, it's not a
	// necessarily symmetric or synchronous transformation.  For example,
	// a zlib stream might take multiple plain-text writes(), and then
	// emit a single compressed chunk some time in the future.
	//
	// Here's how this works:
	//
	// The Transform stream has all the aspects of the readable and writable
	// stream classes.  When you write(chunk), that calls _write(chunk,cb)
	// internally, and returns false if there's a lot of pending writes
	// buffered up.  When you call read(), that calls _read(n) until
	// there's enough pending readable data buffered up.
	//
	// In a transform stream, the written data is placed in a buffer.  When
	// _read(n) is called, it transforms the queued up data, calling the
	// buffered _write cb's as it consumes chunks.  If consuming a single
	// written chunk would result in multiple output chunks, then the first
	// outputted bit calls the readcb, and subsequent chunks just go into
	// the read buffer, and will cause it to emit 'readable' if necessary.
	//
	// This way, back-pressure is actually determined by the reading side,
	// since _read has to be called to start processing a new chunk.  However,
	// a pathological inflate type of transform can cause excessive buffering
	// here.  For example, imagine a stream where every byte of input is
	// interpreted as an integer from 0-255, and then results in that many
	// bytes of output.  Writing the 4 bytes {ff,ff,ff,ff} would result in
	// 1kb of data being output.  In this case, you could write a very small
	// amount of input, and end up with a very large amount of output.  In
	// such a pathological inflating mechanism, there'd be no way to tell
	// the system to stop doing the transform.  A single 4MB write could
	// cause the system to run out of memory.
	//
	// However, even in such a pathological case, only a single written chunk
	// would be consumed, and then the rest would wait (un-transformed) until
	// the results of the previous transformed chunk were consumed.

	// a transform stream is a readable/writable stream where you do
	// something with the data.  Sometimes it's called a "filter",
	// but that's not a great name for it, since that implies a thing where
	// some bits pass through, and others are simply ignored.  (That would
	// be a valid example of a transform, of course.)
	//
	// While the output is causally related to the input, it's not a
	// necessarily symmetric or synchronous transformation.  For example,
	// a zlib stream might take multiple plain-text writes(), and then
	// emit a single compressed chunk some time in the future.
	//
	// Here's how this works:
	//
	// The Transform stream has all the aspects of the readable and writable
	// stream classes.  When you write(chunk), that calls _write(chunk,cb)
	// internally, and returns false if there's a lot of pending writes
	// buffered up.  When you call read(), that calls _read(n) until
	// there's enough pending readable data buffered up.
	//
	// In a transform stream, the written data is placed in a buffer.  When
	// _read(n) is called, it transforms the queued up data, calling the
	// buffered _write cb's as it consumes chunks.  If consuming a single
	// written chunk would result in multiple output chunks, then the first
	// outputted bit calls the readcb, and subsequent chunks just go into
	// the read buffer, and will cause it to emit 'readable' if necessary.
	//
	// This way, back-pressure is actually determined by the reading side,
	// since _read has to be called to start processing a new chunk.  However,
	// a pathological inflate type of transform can cause excessive buffering
	// here.  For example, imagine a stream where every byte of input is
	// interpreted as an integer from 0-255, and then results in that many
	// bytes of output.  Writing the 4 bytes {ff,ff,ff,ff} would result in
	// 1kb of data being output.  In this case, you could write a very small
	// amount of input, and end up with a very large amount of output.  In
	// such a pathological inflating mechanism, there'd be no way to tell
	// the system to stop doing the transform.  A single 4MB write could
	// cause the system to run out of memory.
	//
	// However, even in such a pathological case, only a single written chunk
	// would be consumed, and then the rest would wait (un-transformed) until
	// the results of the previous transformed chunk were consumed.

	// a transform stream is a readable/writable stream where you do
	// something with the data.  Sometimes it's called a "filter",
	// but that's not a great name for it, since that implies a thing where
	// some bits pass through, and others are simply ignored.  (That would
	// be a valid example of a transform, of course.)
	//
	// While the output is causally related to the input, it's not a
	// necessarily symmetric or synchronous transformation.  For example,
	// a zlib stream might take multiple plain-text writes(), and then
	// emit a single compressed chunk some time in the future.
	//
	// Here's how this works:
	//
	// The Transform stream has all the aspects of the readable and writable
	// stream classes.  When you write(chunk), that calls _write(chunk,cb)
	// internally, and returns false if there's a lot of pending writes
	// buffered up.  When you call read(), that calls _read(n) until
	// there's enough pending readable data buffered up.
	//
	// In a transform stream, the written data is placed in a buffer.  When
	// _read(n) is called, it transforms the queued up data, calling the
	// buffered _write cb's as it consumes chunks.  If consuming a single
	// written chunk would result in multiple output chunks, then the first
	// outputted bit calls the readcb, and subsequent chunks just go into
	// the read buffer, and will cause it to emit 'readable' if necessary.
	//
	// This way, back-pressure is actually determined by the reading side,
	// since _read has to be called to start processing a new chunk.  However,
	// a pathological inflate type of transform can cause excessive buffering
	// here.  For example, imagine a stream where every byte of input is
	// interpreted as an integer from 0-255, and then results in that many
	// bytes of output.  Writing the 4 bytes {ff,ff,ff,ff} would result in
	// 1kb of data being output.  In this case, you could write a very small
	// amount of input, and end up with a very large amount of output.  In
	// such a pathological inflating mechanism, there'd be no way to tell
	// the system to stop doing the transform.  A single 4MB write could
	// cause the system to run out of memory.
	//
	// However, even in such a pathological case, only a single written chunk
	// would be consumed, and then the rest would wait (un-transformed) until
	// the results of the previous transformed chunk were consumed.

	// a transform stream is a readable/writable stream where you do
	// something with the data.  Sometimes it's called a "filter",
	// but that's not a great name for it, since that implies a thing where
	// some bits pass through, and others are simply ignored.  (That would
	// be a valid example of a transform, of course.)
	//
	// While the output is causally related to the input, it's not a
	// necessarily symmetric or synchronous transformation.  For example,
	// a zlib stream might take multiple plain-text writes(), and then
	// emit a single compressed chunk some time in the future.
	//
	// Here's how this works:
	//
	// The Transform stream has all the aspects of the readable and writable
	// stream classes.  When you write(chunk), that calls _write(chunk,cb)
	// internally, and returns false if there's a lot of pending writes
	// buffered up.  When you call read(), that calls _read(n) until
	// there's enough pending readable data buffered up.
	//
	// In a transform stream, the written data is placed in a buffer.  When
	// _read(n) is called, it transforms the queued up data, calling the
	// buffered _write cb's as it consumes chunks.  If consuming a single
	// written chunk would result in multiple output chunks, then the first
	// outputted bit calls the readcb, and subsequent chunks just go into
	// the read buffer, and will cause it to emit 'readable' if necessary.
	//
	// This way, back-pressure is actually determined by the reading side,
	// since _read has to be called to start processing a new chunk.  However,
	// a pathological inflate type of transform can cause excessive buffering
	// here.  For example, imagine a stream where every byte of input is
	// interpreted as an integer from 0-255, and then results in that many
	// bytes of output.  Writing the 4 bytes {ff,ff,ff,ff} would result in
	// 1kb of data being output.  In this case, you could write a very small
	// amount of input, and end up with a very large amount of output.  In
	// such a pathological inflating mechanism, there'd be no way to tell
	// the system to stop doing the transform.  A single 4MB write could
	// cause the system to run out of memory.
	//
	// However, even in such a pathological case, only a single written chunk
	// would be consumed, and then the rest would wait (un-transformed) until
	// the results of the previous transformed chunk were consumed.

	// a transform stream is a readable/writable stream where you do
	// something with the data.  Sometimes it's called a "filter",
	// but that's not a great name for it, since that implies a thing where
	// some bits pass through, and others are simply ignored.  (That would
	// be a valid example of a transform, of course.)
	//
	// While the output is causally related to the input, it's not a
	// necessarily symmetric or synchronous transformation.  For example,
	// a zlib stream might take multiple plain-text writes(), and then
	// emit a single compressed chunk some time in the future.
	//
	// Here's how this works:
	//
	// The Transform stream has all the aspects of the readable and writable
	// stream classes.  When you write(chunk), that calls _write(chunk,cb)
	// internally, and returns false if there's a lot of pending writes
	// buffered up.  When you call read(), that calls _read(n) until
	// there's enough pending readable data buffered up.
	//
	// In a transform stream, the written data is placed in a buffer.  When
	// _read(n) is called, it transforms the queued up data, calling the
	// buffered _write cb's as it consumes chunks.  If consuming a single
	// written chunk would result in multiple output chunks, then the first
	// outputted bit calls the readcb, and subsequent chunks just go into
	// the read buffer, and will cause it to emit 'readable' if necessary.
	//
	// This way, back-pressure is actually determined by the reading side,
	// since _read has to be called to start processing a new chunk.  However,
	// a pathological inflate type of transform can cause excessive buffering
	// here.  For example, imagine a stream where every byte of input is
	// interpreted as an integer from 0-255, and then results in that many
	// bytes of output.  Writing the 4 bytes {ff,ff,ff,ff} would result in
	// 1kb of data being output.  In this case, you could write a very small
	// amount of input, and end up with a very large amount of output.  In
	// such a pathological inflating mechanism, there'd be no way to tell
	// the system to stop doing the transform.  A single 4MB write could
	// cause the system to run out of memory.
	//
	// However, even in such a pathological case, only a single written chunk
	// would be consumed, and then the rest would wait (un-transformed) until
	// the results of the previous transformed chunk were consumed.

	// a transform stream is a readable/writable stream where you do
	// something with the data.  Sometimes it's called a "filter",
	// but that's not a great name for it, since that implies a thing where
	// some bits pass through, and others are simply ignored.  (That would
	// be a valid example of a transform, of course.)
	//
	// While the output is causally related to the input, it's not a
	// necessarily symmetric or synchronous transformation.  For example,
	// a zlib stream might take multiple plain-text writes(), and then
	// emit a single compressed chunk some time in the future.
	//
	// Here's how this works:
	//
	// The Transform stream has all the aspects of the readable and writable
	// stream classes.  When you write(chunk), that calls _write(chunk,cb)
	// internally, and returns false if there's a lot of pending writes
	// buffered up.  When you call read(), that calls _read(n) until
	// there's enough pending readable data buffered up.
	//
	// In a transform stream, the written data is placed in a buffer.  When
	// _read(n) is called, it transforms the queued up data, calling the
	// buffered _write cb's as it consumes chunks.  If consuming a single
	// written chunk would result in multiple output chunks, then the first
	// outputted bit calls the readcb, and subsequent chunks just go into
	// the read buffer, and will cause it to emit 'readable' if necessary.
	//
	// This way, back-pressure is actually determined by the reading side,
	// since _read has to be called to start processing a new chunk.  However,
	// a pathological inflate type of transform can cause excessive buffering
	// here.  For example, imagine a stream where every byte of input is
	// interpreted as an integer from 0-255, and then results in that many
	// bytes of output.  Writing the 4 bytes {ff,ff,ff,ff} would result in
	// 1kb of data being output.  In this case, you could write a very small
	// amount of input, and end up with a very large amount of output.  In
	// such a pathological inflating mechanism, there'd be no way to tell
	// the system to stop doing the transform.  A single 4MB write could
	// cause the system to run out of memory.
	//
	// However, even in such a pathological case, only a single written chunk
	// would be consumed, and then the rest would wait (un-transformed) until
	// the results of the previous transformed chunk were consumed.
